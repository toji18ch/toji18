EXPERIMENT No.10 
10.Install and Explore Selenium for automated testing. 
Aim: To perform continuous testing of web applications using Selenium. 
Theory: 
Continuous Testing is the process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery 
pipeline in order to obtain feedback on the business risks associated with a software release 
candidate as rapidly as possible. It evolves and extends test automation to address the increased 
complexity and pace of modern application development and delivery. 
Continuous Testing in DevOps is a software testing type that involves testing the software at 
every stage of the software development life cycle. The goal of Continuous testing is evaluating 
the quality of software at every step of the Continuous Delivery Process by testing early and 
testing often. The continuous testing process in DevOps involves stakeholders like Developer, 
DevOps, QA and 
The old way of testing was hand off centric. The software was handed off from one team to 
another. A project would have definite Development and QA phases. QA teams always wanted 
more time to ensure quality. The goal was that the quality should prevail over project schedule. 
However, business wants faster delivery of software to the end user. The newer is the software, 
the better it can be marketed and increase revenue potential of the company. Hence, a new way of 
testing was evolved. 
Continuous means undisrupted testing done on a continuous basis. In a Continuous DevOps 
process, a software change (release candidate) is continuously moving from Development to 
Testing to Deployment. 
Selenium 
Selenium is an open-source tool which automates web browser testing. It is mainly used for 
functional (unit testing & regression testing). 
Reasons for considering Selenium (advantages): 
1. Programming Language support – Selenium scripts can be written in major programming 
languages like Java, Python, Perl, Php, Ruby and C#. 
2. Web Browser support – Support cross browser testing on chrome, Firefox, internet explorer 
and safari.  
68 
3. Operating Systems support – Selenium can be used on Widows, Mac or Linux. 
In this practical, we would use Selenium for creating test cases, TestNG for getting detailed 
report of those test cases and further we use Jenkins to run our test cases. Jenkins will see if our 
test cases are getting passed and if those test cases fail’s we would receive an email notification. 
And this is how we complete the process of continuous testing in DevOps. 
Test Case: Automate amazon.in search and Facebook login. And at the end, receive a mail 
confirmation if the test result fail. This whole process has to be automated and in continuous 
manner for continuous testing.  
Steps for Demonstration: 
Step 1: Create Test cases with Selenium on Eclipse IDE. 
Step 1.1: Download Selenium standalone-3.9.0.jar and Selenium server-3.9.0.zip files from the 
link below and unzip the file. 
https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=3.9/ 
Step 1.2: Download latest Java as a prerequisite for Eclipse followed by installation of Eclipse. 
Step 1.3: Launch the Eclipse IDE and open Eclipse Marketplace to install TestNG plugin. 
Step 1.4: Restart Eclipse IDE and create a new java project under New 🡪 Project 🡪 Java Project 
and Select JRE 1.8 under “Use Execution Environment for JRE” 
69 
Step 1.5: Now add new package from File Tab.  
Step 1.6: Select Project 🡪 Click New 🡪 Class and Click Finish and enter the below code 
package<Package name>; 
importjava.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; 
importorg.openqa.selenium.By; 
importorg.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; 
70 
importorg.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver; 
public class <File name> { 
public void JenkinsTest() {  
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","file_location"); 
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); 
driver.navigate().to("https://www.amazon.in"); 
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS); 
driver.findElement(By.id("twotabsearchtextbox")).sendKeys("Nike shoes"); 
driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html/body/div[1]/header/div/div[1]/div[3]/div/form/div[2]/div/inp
 ut")).click(); 
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);  
driver.navigate().back(); 
String title = driver.getTitle(); 
System.out.println("Page Title is:-" + title);  
driver.navigate().to("https://www.facebook.com"); 
driver.findElement(By.name("email")).sendKeys("abcd@gmail.com"); 
driver.findElement(By.name("pass")).sendKeys("1234"); 
driver.findElement(By.id("loginbutton")).click();   
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS); 
driver.quit();   
} 
}

Step 1.7: Select Project 🡪 Properties 🡪 Java Build Path 🡪 Select Add External JARs and Select 
all the Jar files in the unzipped Selenium Jar files also in Lib folder and Selenium standalone jar 
file. Apply changes 
72 
Step 1.8: Select and right click Project 🡪 Properties 🡪 Java Build Path 🡪 Select Add Library and 
Select TestNG and click on Finish 
Step 2:Converting into XML files for executing TestNG test suite. 
Step 2.1: Select and right click on Class file 🡪TestNG🡪 Convert to TestNG and type the below 
code in Preview 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd"> 
<suite name="Suite"> 
<test name="Test"> 
<classes> 
<class name="seleniumContinuousTesting"/> 
</classes> 
</test><!-- Test --> 
</suite><!-- Suite --> 
73 
Step 2.2: Open command prompt and change the working directory to the eclipse workspace and 
enter the command 
java -cp C:\Users\SHWETA\eclipse workspace\Selenium\bin;C:\Users\SHWETA\eclipse
workspace\Selenium\lib\* org.testng.TestNG testng.xml 
Test Result: (Explanation: A new chrome browser opens up and automatically open amazon.in 
and enter nike shoes in the search bar and then navigates back again and then open facebook.com 
and login with email: abcd@gmail.com and password: 1234 and hit Login. This has been coded 
in the class file) 
74 
75 
Step 3: Create windows batch file 
Create a Text Document and Type the command below and create a bat file with Save as file 
name as shown below to create a Windows batch file 
java -cpbin;lib/* org.testng.TestNG testing.xml 
Step 4: Build Jenkins jobs by executing the batch file 
Step 4.1: Install Jenkins and setup Jenkins by referring the below guide 
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/windows/ 
Step 4.2: Create a new Freestyle project on Jenkins by browsing to localhost:8080 or whichever 
port has been assigned to Jenkins during the installation. 
76 
Step 4.3: Under General Section 🡪 Tab on Advanced and Select the checkbox “Use custom 
workspace” and in the Directory Form Fill enter the workspace location of Eclipse project 
Step 4.4: Under Build Section 🡪 Select “Add build step” button 🡪 Select Execute Windows 
batch command and in Post-build Actions Section 🡪 Select Add “post-build action” 🡪 Select 
“Email notification” and add your email address in the Recipients field. Finally, click on Apply 
and Save buttons. 
77 
Step 5: Schedule Jobs & configure email notification 
Step 5.1: Go the Jenkins Dashboard 🡪 Manage Jenkins 🡪 Manage Plugins 🡪 Search Email 
Extension Template 🡪 click on the checkbox and click on Install without restart. 
Step 5.2: Turn On “Less Secure app access” of your google account, in order to receive mails 
Step 5.3:  Go the Jenkins Dashboard 🡪 Manage Jenkins 🡪 Configure Systems 
78 
Step 5.4: Scroll down to E-mail Notification section at the bottom and add the details as shown 
below 
Step 5.5: Click on Test configuration by sending test e-mail, Enter mail address in Test e-mail 
recipient and hit Test Configuration Button.  
79 
Step 5.6: Check the test mail in your Gmail inbox 
Step 5.7: Go to the Dashboard 🡪 Select the project 🡪 Select Configure 🡪 Build Trigger Section 
�
� Select Build periodically checkbox and Enter the Schedule details in cron format 
H 10 * * * 
Meaning: In the morning 10 on every date of every month and every day of the week. 
Step 5.8: Go to the Project 🡪 Select Build Now 
80 
Step 5.9: Click on the Build Number “#3” in my case 🡪 click on console output 
Step 5.10: Verify email notification feature by creating an error by commenting any line in class 
file under your project in Eclipse IDE 
Step 5.11: Check your Gmail Inbox for failed Test Case mail 
81 
Conclusion: 
We have successfully completed the task of executing continuous testing with the help of 
Selenium to build test cases, TestNG to create testing.xml file so that we can integrate Jenkins for 
continuous testing on specified time intervals and receive email notification if the test cases fail.
