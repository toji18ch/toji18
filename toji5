Experiment-5: 
Demonstrate continuous integration and development using 
Jenkins 
 
Objective: The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate the implementation of continuous 
integration and development using Jenkins. Specifically, the goal is to create a Jenkins pipeline 
that automates the build, test, and artifact generation process for a sample web application 
hosted on GitHub. 
Description: 
1. Setup Jenkins: Install and configure Jenkins on a server or local machine. 
2. Install Required Plugins: Install necessary plugins in Jenkins such as Git, GitHub, and any 
other plugins required for the pipeline. 
3. Create Pipeline Job: Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins. 
4. Configure Pipeline: Configure the pipeline to fetch the source code from a GitHub 
repository. 
5. Define Stages: Define stages in the pipeline for building, testing, and artifact generation. 
6. Build Stage: In the build stage, compile the source code and package it into a deployable 
artifact. 
7. Test Stage: Execute automated tests on the compiled code to ensure its quality and 
functionality. 
8. Artifact Generation Stage: Generate a .rar artifact containing the necessary files, such as 
dev.html, from the build. 
Steps: 
Your github repository must contain two files ., one is dev.html and next file 
is – jenkinsfile 
 
Jenkinsfile code: 
pipeline { 
    agent any 
     
    stages { 
        stage('Checkout') { 
            steps { 
                // Checkout the repository 
                git branch: 'main', credentialsId: 'GitHubCreds', url: 
'https://github.com/NAGENDRASAICH/htmlfilerepo.git' 
            } 
        } 
         
        stage('Build and Test') { 
            steps { 
                // Here you can perform any build and test operations 
                // For simplicity, let's just print a success message 
                echo 'Build and Test successful!' 
            } 
        } 
         
        stage('Generate Artifact') { 
            steps { 
                // Create the artifacts directory if it doesn't exist 
                sh 'mkdir -p artifacts' 
                // Copy the dev.html file to the artifacts directory 
                sh 'cp dev.html ./artifacts/' 
            } 
        } 
    } 
     
    post { 
        success { 
            // Archive the generated artifact 
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'artifacts/*.html', onlyIfSuccessful: true 
            // Print a success message if the pipeline completes successfully 
            echo 'Pipeline completed successfully!' 
        } 
    } 
} 
 
 
Dev.html code: 
<html> 
      <head> 
             <title>registration form</title> 
      </head> 
      <body> 
      <h6> 
      <label="name">Name:</label> 
      <input type="text" name="name"><br><br> 
     <label="age">Age:</label> 
     <input type="text" name="Age"><br><br> 
     <label="DOB">DOB:</label> 
     <input type="text" name="DOB"><br><br> 
    <label="mobile no">Mobile No:</label> 
    <input type="text" name="mobile no"><br><br> 
    <label="gmail">Gmail:</label> 
    <input type="text" name="Gmail"><br><br> 
    <input type="submit" value="submit"><br><br> 
    </h6> 
    </body> 
</html> 

 
 
 
  
 
As you see these two files are stored in main branch 
 
Now, Copy this URL and paste it in jenkins 

 
 After completion of all stages, artefact will be generated and , by 
clicking on download button you can download an artefact 
 
 
Program Outcomes: 
1. Automated Build Process: Successfully automate the build process of the web 
application using Jenkins. 
2. Automated Testing: Implement automated tests to verify the functionality and quality of 
the code. 
3. Artifact Generation: Generate a .rar artifact containing the dev.html file as per the 
pipeline configuration.
