Experiment-7: 
Develop a simple containerized application using Docker 
Program Objectives: 
1. Introduction to Containerization: Understand the concept of 
containerization and its benefits in application development and 
deployment. 
2. Familiarization with Docker: Gain familiarity with Docker, a popular 
containerization platform, and its basic usage. 
3. Creating Docker Images: Learn how to create Docker images containing 
application files and dependencies. 
4. Running Docker Containers: Understand the process of running Docker 
containers from created images. 
5. Basic Application Deployment: Gain hands-on experience in deploying a 
simple application within a Docker container. 
 
Program Description: 
In this program, you will learn how to containerize a simple application using 
Docker. The application consists of a single HTML file (1.html). You will follow 
these steps: 
1. Create HTML File: Begin by creating a simple HTML file (1.html) with some 
content. This file will serve as the content of your containerized application. 
2. Write Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile, a text file that contains instructions for 
building a Docker image. In the Dockerfile, specify the base image, copy the 
HTML file into the image, and define any necessary configurations. 
3. Build Docker Image: Use the Docker CLI to build a Docker image based on 
the Dockerfile you created. This process involves executing the docker build 
command with appropriate parameters. 
6. Run Docker Container: Once the Docker image is built successfully, use the 
docker run command to instantiate a Docker container from the created 
image. Specify any necessary options such as port mappings or volume 
mounts. 
7. Access Application: Access the running application by opening a web 
browser and navigating to the appropriate URL, typically 
http://localhost:<port> if port mapping was configured. 
 
 
sudo docker run -d -p 8888:80 --name my-html-container my-html-image
