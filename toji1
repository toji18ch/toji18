1.a) Install Flutter and Dart SDK. 
1. System Requirements: 
Before installing Flutter, ensure that your system meets the following requirements: 
•	Operating System: Flutter supports Windows (7 or later), macOS (10.14 or later), and Linux (64- bit). 
•	Disk Space: At least 400 MB of free disk space. 
•	Tools: Git for macOS and Linux, and Power Shell for Windows (required for running Flutter commands). 
•	Android Studio or Visual Studio Code (optional but recommended for Flutter development). 

2. Download Flutter: 
Visit the Flutter website and download the Flutter SDK for your operating system. 
You can choose between stable, beta, or dev releases based on your preference. 
3. Extract the Flutter SDK: 
Once the download is complete, extract the downloaded ZIP file 
to a location on your computer where you want to store the Flutter SDK. 
For example, on macOS or Linux, you can extract it to your home directory or any other preferred location. 
4. Set Up Flutter Environment: 
Add the Flutter bin directory to your system's PATH environment variable. 
This step allows you to run Flutter commands from any terminal window. 
•	On macOS and Linux, you can do this by editing your shell configuration file (e.g., .bash profile, .zshrc, or .bashrc) and adding the following line: 

Replace <path_to_flutter_sdk> with the actual path 
Where you extracted the Flutter SDK. 
•	On Windows, you can add the Flutter bin directory to the system's PATH by following these instructions. 

5. Verify Flutter Installation: 
Open a new terminal window and run the following command to verify that Flutter is properly installed: 

This command should display the Flutter version and Dart version if Flutter is installed correctly. 
6. Install Dart SDK: 

Flutter comes with its own copy of the Dart SDK, so you don't need to install Dart separately. However, if you want to use Dart for non-Flutter projects or development, you can download the Dart SDK from the Dart website and follow the installation instructions provided.

intsum=num1 + num2;
int diff = num1 - num2; intmul=num1 * num2;
doublediv=num1/num2;//Itisdoublebecauseitoutputsnumberwith decimal.
